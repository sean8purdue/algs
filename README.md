## Overview

<IMG SRC="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cover.png"  align=right hspace=25 width=100 alt = "Algorithms 4/e textbook">

This repository is intended to practice general data structure and algorithms in Java by Guo Li. The Readme file is copied from the original repository. Thanks to Prof. Robert Sedgewick and Prof. Kevin Wayne and all code workers to make such good learning material for public!

This <a href = "https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4">public repository</a>
contains the Java <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">source code</a>
for the algorithms and clients in the textbook
<a href = "http://amzn.to/13VNJi7">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
This is the official version&mdash;it is actively maintained and updated by the authors.
The programs are organized in the package <code>edu.princeton.cs.algs4</code>.
If you need only the class files (and not the source code), you can use
<a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar">algs4.jar</a> instead.
